How I made my demo GIFs
I followed this very good tutorial : https://www.foell.org/justin/creating-an-animated-gif-using-vlc-gimp/

1) Shoot the video
With VLC, film your desktop with 2 FPS
Go to "Media/Convert/Save..."
    Capture Device
        Capture mode : Desktop
        Options : 2 FPS
    Profile
        Video H.264 (in the settings I disabled the audio)
    Choose a destination file the start
When you have nothing more to film, press the stop button in VLC.

2) Get the image files from the video
I used "avconv" on my Debian
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install libav-tools
   avconv -i [YOURVIDEFILE.mp4] -r 2 [OUTPUTPATH/img-%3d.png]

3) Sort your IMG
Remove the imgs you don't need for your GIF
  
4) Create the GIF
I used GIMP
Open GIMP
    File/Open as Layers
    Select all your IMG files for the GIF you want to create

If you don't see all your layers in a column
    Windows/Dockable Dialogs/ Layers

Use the eyes ico to work on a specif img (ie : add some texts)
To add text
    Right click on the img/Tools/Text
    you may have to go to the layers column to choose for which img the text will apply
    ie :
        img 490...
        textX : the text
        img 457 : the img I want to have a text
        img 433...
    To merge the text with the img 
        you should lock the imgs under this img
        then right click on the text => Merge Down
    
To reduce the size
    Keep the essential by cropping
        Tools/Selection Tools/Rectangle Select
        Select the area you want to keep (it will be the same area for all the IMGs of your project)
        Then crop
            Image/Crop to Selection
    Keep a low level of colors
        Image/Mode
            Indexed...
                I chose to keep 63 colors 
                Convert
    I didn't use the GIF filter but I you want to:
        Filters/Animation/Optimize (for GIF)
     
Choose a tempo for each img
    On the layers column, right click on each img
        Edit Layer Attributes
            Layer name = img-457.png(2000ms)
    My img num 457 will be show for 2 seconds.
     
Export your project  
    File/Export As...
        mygif1.gif => Export
            Gif comment => don't use any accent
            As animation, the rest by default
    
5) Test your GIF
